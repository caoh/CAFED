# CAFED Q&A - User Feedback

1. What is the fastest way to get familiar with the platform?
--* We put a quickstart video online (you can see it from the start page and within the annotation page).
2. I've used the zooming tool but cannot zoom out. How do I proceed?
--* We've now added tooltips (move your mouse over those tools to get some hints) and added clearly distinguishable question mark icons with some more hints.
3. For each household, how do I make sure that the bursts and peeks I see for a specific (appliance/household) pair are not singular events?
--* First, we scaled the graphs to the maximum value for each appliance/household pair, to get an overview of the appliance's usage over the whole span of the data collected for this pair.
--* We provide additional side information (the next day following the current day to be annotated).
4. I believe that one additionial day is not enough
