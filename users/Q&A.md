# CAFED Q&A - User Feedback

1. What is the fastest way to get familiar with the platform?
--* We put a quickstart video online (you can see it from the start page and within the annotation page).
2. I've used the zooming tool but cannot zoom out. How do I proceed?
--* We've now added tooltips (move your mouse over those tools to get some hints) and added clearly distinguishable question mark icons with some more hints.
3. For each household, how do I make sure that the bursts and peeks I see for a specific (appliance/household) pair are not singular events?
--* First, we scaled the graphs to the maximum value for each appliance/household pair, to get an overview of the appliance's usage over the whole span of the data collected for this pair.
--* We provide additional side information (the next day following the current day to be annotated).
4. I believe that one additionial day is not enough to get a feeling of whether an event happens by chance or whether there is a trend.
--* We now provide 7 consecutive days in total (the current day to annotate and the 6 next days).
5. I've made a mistake, how do I amend my annotations?
--* We are planning on releasing a correction tool to review past annotations. At the moment, please email the admin.
6. I do not like to use the mouse too much. What can be done to speed up the selection of the tools?
--* We now have added key strokes recognition. Press "s" for selecting the pencil, "d" for the eraser and "f" for zooming.
7. When can I download the data?
--* As soon as you've unlocked the download badge (meaning you have obtained both the frequent flyer and the endurance badges on the current day).
